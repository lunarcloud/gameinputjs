# How to contribute

This is mostly a one-dev show, but I've made this open-source for two reasons:
 * So that others may learn and steal from the techniques I've employed here.
 * So the possibility of a community-provided feature or fix is open. 

## Submitting changes

I reserve the right to accept or reject any and all pull requests. 
Ideally, you should be solving an open issue.

## Coding conventions

  * Run and accept the linter's judgement as much as humanly possible.
  * We use JSDoc for our typing. Many editors support and are more useful because of it.
  * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. Document as much as possible and use a neutral, objective tone.
  * Don't rely on CDNs and avoid adding dependencies as much as possible.

Thanks,
Sam
