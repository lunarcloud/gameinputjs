GameInput JS
=============

Include [gameinput.js](https://github.com/lunarcloud/gameinputjs/blob/master/gameinput.js), typically [gameinput.models.js](https://github.com/lunarcloud/gameinputjs/blob/master/gameinput.models.js) for automatic mapping of gamepads, and hopefully [gameinput.custom.js](https://github.com/lunarcloud/gameinputjs/blob/master/gameinput.custom.js) for customizable mapping ("push attack button") in your project and hook it up to your game or other gamepad-powered application.

All other files in the repository are to test and create mappings and to show example usage.

Mappings
----------
Feel free to test your favorite controller out with [creator.html](https://github.com/lunarcloud/gameinputjs/blob/master/creator.html) and submit it to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lunarcloud/gameinputjs/issues)

License
---------
MIT - do what you like

I do not care if the license is accidentally missing from your minified source, although most minifiers should preserve the license comments.
